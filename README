Dockerised `autoland transplant` for development.


OVERVIEW

Autoland is a tool that automatically lands patches from one Mercurial tree
to another. It is used at Mozilla to land requests from MozReview
(Review Board) and Lando (Phabricator).


QUICK START

Run `./create-virtualenv` to create the venv required for testing (and useful
for IDE integration).  Requires PostgreSQL 9.5 client libraries.

Run `docker-compose up --build --detach` to start the environment.

Use http://localhost:8100/ to access autoland-transplant and
http://localhost:8101/ to access the Mercurial repository.

Edit files in `autoland/` and run `docker-compose up --build --detach` again
to deploy your changes into the development environment.

Run tests with `./run-tests`.
